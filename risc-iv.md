# RISC-IV Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Documentation

The RISC-IV ISA is a simple register-based instruction set inspired by the RISC-V architecture. This documentation provides an overview of the instructions available in the RISC-IV ISA, their syntax, and their semantics.

## Architecture Overview

The RISC-IV architecture is a 32-bit RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architecture inspired by the RISC-V specification. It features:

- 32 general-purpose registers (including one hardwired zero register)
- Fixed-length 4-byte instructions
- Load-store architecture (memory access only through specific instructions)
- Simple addressing modes
- Memory-mapped I/O
- Support for function calls and returns through jump-and-link instructions
- Arithmetic, logical, and control flow operations

This architecture provides a clean, orthogonal instruction set that exemplifies RISC design principles, making it excellent for educational purposes while still being powerful enough for practical applications.

Comments in RISC-IV assembly code are denoted by the `;` character.

## Immediate Value Relocation Directives

The RISC-IV assembly language provides special directives for handling larger immediate values that don't fit within the standard instruction formats:

- **%hi(symbol)**
    - **Description:** Used to extract the upper 20 bits of a 32-bit address or immediate value
    - **Usage:** `lui rd, %hi(symbol)`
    - **Operation:** `rd <- (symbol & 0xFFFFF000)`

- **%lo(symbol)**
    - **Description:** Used to extract the lower 12 bits of a 32-bit address or immediate value
    - **Usage:** `addi rd, rs, %lo(symbol)`
    - **Operation:** `rd <- rs + (symbol & 0x00000FFF)`

These directives are typically used together to load a full 32-bit address into a register:

```assembly
lui  a0, %hi(address)    ; Load upper 20 bits into a0
addi a0, a0, %lo(address) ; Add lower 12 bits to a0
```
